# advent-of-code-2022

Here, I will be posting my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 puzzles.  
I will be using Python 3.11.

### The structure of this repository

Each day's solution will be in a separate folder, containing:

- a README.md file, containing the puzzle description
- a solution.py file, containing the solution to the puzzle
- a test.txt file, containing the test input for the puzzle
- an input.txt file, containing the actual input for the puzzle

I hope you enjoy my solutions, and I hope you have a great Advent of Code 2022!

Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any way to improve my solutions or if you have any questions about them.

### Graphical representation of my solutions

I added a Graphical User Interface to my solutions, using Tkinter.  
To set it up, you need to add a ["config.py"](gui/config.py) file in the ["gui" folder](gui), containing the following line :

```python
SESSION_ID =  # Your session ID, found in your browser's cookies
```

This will allow you to download your input directly from the website and display **your own results** in the GUI.  
Then you can run the ["gui/main.py" file](gui/main.py) to launch the GUI.

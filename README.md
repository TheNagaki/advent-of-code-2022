# advent-of-code-2022

Here, I will be posting my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 puzzles.  
I will be using Python 3.7.

Each day's solution will be in a separate folder, containing:

- a README.md file, containing the puzzle description
- a solution.py file, containing the solution to the puzzle
- a test.txt file, containing the test input for the puzzle
- an input.txt file, containing the actual input for the puzzle

I hope you enjoy my solutions, and I hope you have a great Advent of Code 2022!

Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any way to improve my solutions or if you have any questions about them.
